## @atomico/element

It allows to join [@atomico/core](https://github.com/atomicojs/core) to web-components in a simple and expressive way

## What is Atomico?

Atomico is a [personal](https://github.com/uppercod) Open Source project, whose mission is to simplify the creation of sustainable and scalable interfaces with minimal impact on browser resources.

## From React to web-component

Do not forget that these libraries are similar in api, but Atomico's orientation is to encourage the use of web-components with or without Atomico, since web-components are agnostic to framework or libraries.

### Import differences

![import](https://res.cloudinary.com/dz0i8dmpt/image/upload/v1557340605/github/atomico-element/import.png)

you will need 2 imports, [@atomico/element](https://github.com/atomicojs/element) this allows you to work with web-components and [@atomico/core](https://github.com/atomicojs/core) that has support for hooks, context, HoCs, virtual-dom and more.

### Component to web-component

![component](https://res.cloudinary.com/dz0i8dmpt/image/upload/v1557340605/github/atomico-element/component.png)

**Atomico allows both syntax**, so you can use components and web-components together, but now we focus on the creation of web-components

### Fragment to host

Atomico does not have support for fragments, but to improve the development experience Atomico creates the tag `<host>`, this has an effect similar to the css selector `:host{}`

The `<host>` tag brings better benefits, since it allows to manipulate properties and attributes of the web-component from the same JSX, the following image shows the difference between a vanilla web-component and the atomic host tag, to understand its benefit and equivalence.

### Render to customElement

![render](https://res.cloudinary.com/dz0i8dmpt/image/upload/v1557340605/github/atomico-element/render.png)

render allows to point the component to a specific node of the document, customElement allows associating its function to a web-component, so you should only invoke the web-component from the HTML, React or Vue, without worrying about specifying the node.

## definition of observables

The above shows the similar, the `observables` are the Atomico layer to define properties and attributes of the web-component, to identify the types and force them if they come from a `string` Atomico makes use of the declarations like `Number`, `String`,`Boolean`, `Object`, `Array`, `Function` and `Promise`, to define the types of properties and attributes.

![observables](https://res.cloudinary.com/dz0i8dmpt/image/upload/v1557340605/github/atomico-element/observables.png)

every attribute is defined as property so you can use `document.querySelector("my-wc").value = "new value"` for its definition.

Observables are not limited to just one property you can create more complex sets.

```js
MyWc.observables = {
	isChecked: Boolean, //html: <my-wc is-checked/>
	value: String, //html: <my-wc value='....'/>
	id: Number, //html: <my-wc id='10'/>
	data: Object //html: <my-wc data='{"name":"atomico"}'/>
};
```

## Web-component as a class

The functional behavior is to simplify the expressiveness of a web-component, but the real api is a class, you can make use of this, the greatest benefit of using classes that the events maintain the context of `this` without the need to use `bind`

```jsx
import { h, Element } from "@atomico/element";

class ShowEmoji extends Element {
	static observables = {
		checked: Boolean
	};
	toggle() {
		this.checked = !this.checked;
	}
	render({ checked = false }) {
		return (
			<host shadowDom>
				{checked && "ðŸ˜ƒ"}
				<button onClick={this.toggle}>toggle emoji</button>
			</host>
		);
	}
}
```

> The hooks can also be used within render.

## Example

### Simple shop

This small example was created by using `npm init @atomico`, it is a source for learning to develop PWA applications with Atomico.
